#### Background

Atlas da Notícia (News Atlas) is a pioneering project aimed at mapping the local and regional press in Brazil amidst the digital revolution. It is carried on through a partnership between Projor – Instituto para o Desenvolvimento do Jornalismo and the data-driven news agency [Volt Data Lab](https://voltdata.info).

Atlas is focused on identifying local outlets covering civic local subjects, such as public spending, local law making process, health, education, security, mobility and the environment. It has also been planned into incremental phases.

Completed and published in November 2017, the first phase has identified 5,354 news outlets (both print and digital) in 1,125 of a total of Brazilian 5,570 municipalities. Conversely, Atlas has revealed the existence of so-called “news deserts” in 4,500 municipalities, home to 70 million people, some 35% of Brazilian population.

The first phase has also delivered an open database and a report including a series of analytical texts, maps and charts published by Observatório da Imprensa, Projor’s media watchdog website.

**Atlas da Notícia** is inspired by the America’s Growing Deserts of News project, developed by the Columbia Journalism Review to map local newspapers in the United States.

The second phase aims to improve Atlas's interactive platform and database and also to develop deeper on-site analytical research in a sample of “news deserts."

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Atlas da Not√≠cia (News Atlas) is a pioneering project aimed at mapping the local and regional press in Brazil amidst the digital revolution. It is carried on through a partnership between Projor ‚Äì Instituto para o Desenvolvimento do Jornalismo and the data-driven news agency <a href="https://voltdata.info">Volt Data Lab</a>.</p>

<p>Atlas is focused on identifying local outlets covering civic local subjects, such as public spending, local law making process, health, education, security, mobility and the environment. It has also been planned into incremental phases.</p>

<p>Completed and published in November 2017, the first phase has identified 5,354 news outlets (both print and digital) in 1,125 of a total of Brazilian 5,570 municipalities. Conversely, Atlas has revealed the existence of so-called ‚Äúnews deserts‚Äù in 4,500 municipalities, home to 70 million people, some 35% of Brazilian population.</p>

<p>The first phase has also delivered an open database and a report including a series of analytical texts, maps and charts published by Observat√≥rio da Imprensa, Projor‚Äôs media watchdog website.</p>

<p><strong>Atlas da Not√≠cia</strong> is inspired by the America‚Äôs Growing Deserts of News project, developed by the Columbia Journalism Review to map local newspapers in the United States.</p>

<p>The second phase aims to improve Atlas‚Äôs interactive platform and database and also to develop deeper on-site analytical research in a sample of ‚Äúnews deserts.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Atlas da Not√≠cia 2.0</strong> has been carried out by a network of five regional researchers who analyzed the data provided by volunteer collaborators through our crowdsourcing effort under the oversight of Volt Data Lab</p>

<p>The resulting mapping brings the best possible panorama with detailed information on the existence, medium and periodicity of news vehicles in Brazil</p>

<p>Since this is a new database,  figures should considered as  estimates,  given the changing nature of the Brazilian media landscape, marked by closures and the creation of new
vehicles</p>

<p>As our project advances , we will  refine our database, identifying new vehicles and removing those who do not fit our methodology  (closed and non-journalistic vehicles)</p>

<p>We welcome corrections and data updates. Our next edition (November 2019) will incorporate the new information to be verified by our team</p>
